Using React with SpringBoot

First we go to our terminal to initialize the react application by doing this
npx -create-react-app #application name
What this does is it creates a react build based on the folder you installed it from

Once its installed you have to open that file from your IDE
In the terminal type npm start

To start writing your react code, your function must be something like this

export default function #functionName(){
(
return
#html code
)
}

This return value that we get from react is called a 'jsx' which is a javascript extension.
Basically our html element which is returned in a js function
